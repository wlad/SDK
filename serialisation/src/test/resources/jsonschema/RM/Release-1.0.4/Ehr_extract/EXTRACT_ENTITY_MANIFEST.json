In repeat (standing order) requests, the final inclusion may be modified by the send_changes_only value for `EXTRACT_UPDATE_SPEC._update_method_`.\n\nVarious identifiers may be provided for the entity; these are to be used by the receiver system to locate the entity. The `_extract_id_key_` attribute is used to record the identifier that will be used throughout the Extract for this entity, including in instances of `EXTRACT_ENTITY_IDENTIFIER`.",
